# Face-Tracking
In this repository I will show you how to do face tracking using Python and Computer Vision. Python is one of the best languages to work with computer vision because of the ease implementation with external libraries. In this project, we will make a robot with a camera mounted on it to track the movements of our faces. 

To control the robot and make its movements smooth, I wrote a PID controller algorithm (in the main code) to make the servos to move smoothly.
